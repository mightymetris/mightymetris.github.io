Our first family joyride was kind of a :poop: show! The dealer slathered the floors with ArmorAllÂ® so the dogs just sloshed around the back passenger cargo area at the slightest tilt of the wheel. Imagine what sharp turns were like. The slippery footing was causing Toby extreme anxiety.  When we parked to disembark, Toby had his paws curled around the driver seat, gripping the seats like his life depended on it, which was not good since `1` the dogs could easily punch holes in our leatherette seats and `2` the dogs have no business in the front driver/passenger compartment in the first place.

Here are our solutions to make our Metris more dog friendly...

### DIY Foam Floors:

| **Problem:** | Need non-slip flooring to keep the dogs safe and comfortable! |
| **Solution:** | Installed TrafficMaster 4-Pack Grey Activity Foam Tiles to cover passenger cargo. |
| **Notes:** | |
| **Cost:** | $25 x 3 = $75 (with tiles to spare in case we want to make mods) |
