| **Problem:** | The vinyl flooring for the driver and front passenger were getting worn down. Needed floormats stat! |
| **Solution:** | WeatherTech #448731 1st Row Floor Liners (Driver & Passenger) |
| **Cost:** | $109.95 floormats + $18.00 shipping = $127.95 total (purchased from weathertech.com) |
| **Links:** | ![](/images/icons/amazon.png){:height="36px" width="36px"} [WeatherTech 448731 Front Row Floor Liners for 2016 Mercedes-Benz Metris](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0725P4H6B/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0725P4H6B&linkCode=as2&tag=mightymetris-20&linkId=60e794707231a84fb613f2aa30b7409a) |
| **Notes:** | Holy :cow2: ! Why are these floormats so expensive? The OEM Mercedes-Benz mats were something like $165 for the front pair plus $20 shipping so these actually were a little bit cheaper than the OEM, but not by much. Worst part about it is the passenger side mat doesn't click-in like the driver side mat does so it requires an additional velcro adhesive or non-slip liner to get it to stay put. I'll let you know if they hold up! |
